The recent fly by of the S2 star through its pericenter allowed to verify relativistic effects in the galactic center based on the robust detection of the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 \citep{2018A&A...615L..15G}. The detection of relativistic corrections for the S2 orbit are yet out of precision due to the large distance ($1400r_{\rm Sch}$) of the pericenter to an assumend BH in the galactic center. \citet{arguelles_novel_2018} has shown that a quantum core, composed of degenerate fermions, provides a feasible alternative for the BH scenario. It is shown here that their semi-degenerate mass distributions of massive fermions are able to reproduce the relativistic redshift corrections.
